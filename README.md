# Eesti informaatikaolümpiaad

My implementations of some of the Estonian programming olympiads.

The exercises can be foudn on [EIO site](Eesti informaatikaolümpiaad).

## Rules

I'm implementing them in Rust. Vanilla Rust only, no dependencies allowed.

To validate the programs, get the "Testid ja lahendused" and run `run_tests.sh` (adjust the paths in the script if necessary).

Each execise has a time limit, that would apply on a 1,5 GHz Pentium IV. I get an approximation of my program's speed with 'hyperfine'.
